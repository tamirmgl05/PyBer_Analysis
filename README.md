• We can actually predict the results. The results will depend on the population which controls supply and demand(ride needs) in this case. Obviously, the population of Urban area is higher than the other two. According to our analysis, Urban area has way more rides, drivers than Suburban and Rural area. Thus, total fares are higher as well. Because of high population, supply and demand is high.  

• The total fares in Rural area are $4,327.93, Suburban are $19,356.33, and Urban are $39,854.38. Therefore, there is more revenue in the Urban area.

• The line chart above shows the total fare by city type between January 1, 2019 and April 29, 2019. The total fare 
 

• On the other hand, in the Rural area there are more demand for drivers. Thus, average fare per driver($55.49) is way more compared to Suburban($39.50) and Urban($16.57) areas.
