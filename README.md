# PyBer_Analysis

Overview of the analysis:

• The purpose of this project was to analyse ride-sharing data by city type such as Urban, Rural, and Suburban. We wanted to find out information about total rides, drivers, fare, and averages by each city type.

• We can actually predict the results. The results will depend on the population which controls supply and demand(ride needs) in this case. Obviously, the population of Urban area is higher than the other two. According to our analysis, Urban area has way more rides, drivers than Suburban and Rural area. Thus, total fares are higher as well. Because of high population, supply and demand is high.  

• The total fares in Rural area are $4,327.93, Suburban are $19,356.33, and Urban are $39,854.38. Therefore, there is more revenue in the Urban area.

• The line chart above shows the total fare by city type between January 1, 2019 and April 29, 2019. The total fares for the urban area was the highest at the end of the February and the beginning of the March. 

• The total fares for the suburban area was the highest at the end of the February just like urban area. 
 
• Unlike urban and suburban areas, the total fares for the rural area reached it's highest rate in April, 2019. 

Summary:

° The total revenue is the highest in Urban area. 

° The cost of per ride is more than $10 in Rural area than Urban area. This will decrease the demand for using ride share in the rural area. 

° The drivers in the rural area earns more money per ride than the drivers in urban area.
